# WD Diploma - Capstone Project

**Project Title:** osu!Lite / spOSU!fy  
**Author:** Brandon Ong  
**Cohort:** Web Development 2022 (Part-time)  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

## 1.1 Description

A circle clicking rhythm game where users can connect their Spotify account and play along while listening to their favorite playlists/songs.

## 1.2 Problem
